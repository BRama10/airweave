# UI Coherence Plan for CollectionDetailView

## Overview
After analyzing the CollectionDetailView, Search, SearchProcess, SearchResponse, and SourceConnectionStateView components, I've identified several inconsistencies in styling, spacing, colors, and component organization that need to be addressed for a cohesive, modern 2025 design aesthetic.

## Current Issues Analysis

After analyzing the attached components (Search, SearchBox, SearchProcess, SearchResponse, SourceConnectionStateView, EntityStateList, CollectionDetailView), I've identified several coherence issues:

### Visual Inconsistencies
- **Button sizes**: Mix of h-8, h-10, h-5, h-6 across components
- **Text sizes**: Inconsistent use of text-xs, text-sm, text-base, text-[11px], text-[13px]
- **Border radius**: Mix of rounded-md, rounded-lg, rounded-2xl
- **Spacing**: Inconsistent padding (p-1, p-2, p-3, p-4) and gaps (gap-1, gap-2, gap-3, gap-4)
- **Color schemes**: Different approaches to dark/light theming
- **Card designs**: Different shadow and border treatments

### Specific Manager Feedback Issues
1. Code button color in search box (currently sky-900/sky-700)
2. Arrow/stop button aesthetics in search box
3. Search process/response not foldable like entity detail view
4. Component size inconsistencies
5. Brand color coherence
6. "Add Source" button placement (should be in source connection row)
7. "Refresh All" button placement (should be with refresh source button)

## Design System Foundation

### Colors (Primary Brand Palette)
- **Primary**: `blue-600` (light) / `blue-400` (dark)
- **Primary Hover**: `blue-700` (light) / `blue-300` (dark)
- **Secondary**: `gray-100` (light) / `gray-800` (dark)
- **Accent**: `indigo-600` (light) / `indigo-400` (dark)
- **Success**: `emerald-600` (light) / `emerald-400` (dark)
- **Warning**: `amber-600` (light) / `amber-400` (dark)
- **Error**: `red-600` (light) / `red-400` (dark)
- **Border**: `gray-200` (light) / `gray-700` (dark)
- **Background**: `white` (light) / `gray-900` (dark)`

### Standardized Sizes
- **Button Heights**: `h-6` (compact), `h-8` (secondary), `h-10` (primary)
- **Card Padding**: `p-4` (default), `p-3` (compact), `p-6` (spacious)
- **Text Sizes**: `text-[10px]` (labels), `text-xs` (body), `text-sm` (headers)
- **Icon Sizes**: `h-3 w-3` (inline), `h-4 w-4` (buttons), `h-5 w-5` (large)
- **Rounded Corners**: `rounded-md` (buttons/inputs), `rounded-lg` (cards)
- **Spacing**: `gap-2` (standard), `gap-3` (sections), `gap-4` (major sections)

## Action Plan (TODO List)

### Phase 1: Establish Design System Constants
- [ ] **1.1** Define consistent button heights (primary: h-10, secondary: h-8, compact: h-6)
- [ ] **1.2** Standardize text sizes (headers: text-sm font-medium, body: text-xs, labels: text-[10px] uppercase)

- [ ] make sure the json syntax highlighting is the same between search response and process in dark mode
- [ ] the search box cancel button with the square needs to be the same style as the cancel sync button in sourceconnectionstateview


## Implementation Priority

**High Priority (Manager Feedback)**:
- Phase 2 (SearchBox refinements)
- Phase 3 (Collapsibility)
- Phase 4 (Layout restructuring)

**Medium Priority (Core Coherence)**:
- Phase 1 (Design system)
- Phase 5 (Size standardization)
- Phase 6 (Color unification)

**Low Priority (Polish)**:
- Phase 7-11 (Interactive states, typography, shadows, component refinements, final polish)

## Success Metrics

- [ ] All buttons use consistent height classes (h-6, h-8, or h-10)
- [ ] All text uses consistent size classes from defined scale
- [ ] All components use same border radius approach
- [ ] All spacing follows consistent gap/padding scale
- [ ] Brand colors are consistently applied
- [ ] Layout matches manager's structural requirements
- [ ] Search components have collapsible behavior
- [ ] Visual hierarchy is clear and consistent
- [ ] Code button uses neutral colors instead of sky-900/sky-700
- [ ] Arrow/stop button has refined aesthetics
- [ ] "Add Source" button is in source connections row
- [ ] "Refresh All" button is with individual refresh button

## Implementation Notes

- Each task should be implemented incrementally to allow for testing and refinement
- Maintain all existing functionality while improving the visual design
- Consider creating shared component variants for common patterns (buttons, cards, etc.)
- Test thoroughly in both light and dark modes
- Ensure changes don't break any existing user workflows
- Focus on high-priority phases first to address immediate manager feedback
- Use consistent transition durations and easing functions throughout
- Ensure proper accessibility and keyboard navigation
